# Traffic Light Sequence Simulator: Objective: Simulate a traffic light system where each light sequence is represented as a tuple (color, duration).
# Tasks: Create a list of light sequences (e.g., ("green", 60), ("yellow", 10), ("red", 50)). 
# Use pattern matching to simulate the traffic light operation, printing which light is on and for how long. 
# Include safety checks to ensure the sequence always goes green -> yellow -> red.
